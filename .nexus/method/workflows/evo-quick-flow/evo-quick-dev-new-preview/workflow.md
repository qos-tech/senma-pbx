# Quick Dev New Preview Workflow

**Goal:** Take a user request from intent through implementation, adversarial review, and PR creation in a single unified flow.

**Your Role:** You are an elite developer. You clarify intent, plan precisely, implement autonomously, review adversarially, and present findings honestly. Minimum ceremony, maximum signal.


## READY FOR DEVELOPMENT STANDARD

A specification is "Ready for Development" when:

- **Actionable**: Every task has a file path and specific action.
- **Logical**: Tasks ordered by dependency.
- **Testable**: All ACs use Given/When/Then.
- **Complete**: No placeholders or TBDs.


## SCOPE STANDARD

A specification should target a **single user-facing goal** within **900–1600 tokens**:

- **Single goal**: One cohesive feature, even if it spans multiple layers/files. Multi-goal means >=2 **top-level independent shippable deliverables**, each could be reviewed, tested, and merged as a separate PR without breaking the others. Never count surface verbs, "and" conjunctions, or noun phrases. Never split cross-layer implementation details inside one user goal.
  - Split: "add dark mode toggle AND refactor auth to JWT AND build admin dashboard"
  - Don't split: "add validation and display errors" / "support drag-and-drop AND paste AND retry"
- **900–1600 tokens**: Optimal range for LLM consumption. Below 900 risks ambiguity; above 1600 risks context-rot in implementation agents.
- **Neither limit is a gate.** Both are proposals with user override.


## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

**HOW to pace this:** Read fully and follow: `{project-root}/.nexus/method/core/workflows/one-step-at-a-time/workflow.md` before step 1. One step file in memory, the step finished before the next is read, and a full stop at every checkpoint.

This uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is self-contained and followed exactly
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only load the current step file
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Complete steps in order, no skipping
- **State Tracking**: Persist progress via spec frontmatter and in-memory variables
- **Append-Only Building**: Build artifacts incrementally

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Read the entire step file before acting
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute sections in order
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: Halt at checkpoints and wait for human
4. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, read fully and follow the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously
- **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution
- **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence
- **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file
- **ALWAYS** halt at checkpoints and wait for human input


## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

### 1. Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from `{main_config}` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`
- `active_issue` = the issue key this run is scoped to (from `project.yaml` active feature / the run)
- Fixed by contract (not config keys): docs live in `{project-root}/.nexus/docs/`, specs in `{project-root}/.nexus/specs/{active_issue}/`, the board is `{project-root}/.nexus/board.yaml` (read-only)
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)
- CLAUDE.md / memory files (load if exist)

YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`.

### 2. Paths

- `templateFile` = `./tech-spec-template.md`
- `wipFile` = `{project-root}/.nexus/specs/{active_issue}/tech-spec-wip.md`

### 3. First Step Execution

Read fully and follow: `./steps/step-01-clarify-and-route.md` to begin the workflow.
